I wanted to extend my heartfelt gratitude to Jon Barron for generously sharing source code of his public academic website, https://jonbarron.info/. His willingness to provide this valuable resource to the community is truly appreciated, and it reflects his commitment to fostering learning and knowledge sharing. 
I have cloned his website for my personal use, and I will certainly attribute the source to his original website as per his request. His website's design and content have been a great source of inspiration for me, and I am excited to incorporate some of his ideas into my own online presence.
You are welcome to clone this code for your own personal use, just please attribute the source to the original website or to this repo. If you do clone this website, feel free to add an attribution link to your own downstream website in index.html if you want.
